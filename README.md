## How It All Began

Pawz started as a humble WhatsApp group with a goal to address the plight of stray dogs on our campus. The group worked tirelessly to:

- Vaccinate stray dogs to ensure their safety and that of the community.
- Raise funds for surgeries and critical medical treatments.
- Provide food, shelter, and ongoing care to these animals.

This website is our effort to scale these activities and bring more people into this meaningful cause.
